## Concepts

### eBPF

eBPF (or "extended Berkeley Packet Filter"), is a technology that allows safe mini programs to be attached to various
low-level hooks in the Linux kernel. eBPF has a wide variety of uses, including networking, security, and tracing.
Youâ€™ll see a lot of non-networking projects leveraging eBPF, but for $[prodname] our focus is on networking,
and in particular, pushing the networking capabilities of the latest Linux kernels to the limit.

## Before you begin

### Supported

- x86-64
- arm64 (little-endian)

- Kubernetes datastore driver.

- Distributions:

  - Generic or kubeadm
  - kOps
  - OpenShift
  - EKS
  - AKS
  - MKE

- Linux distribution/kernel:

  - Ubuntu 20.04 or above.
  - Red Hat v8.2 with Linux kernel v4.18.0-193 or above (Red Hat have backported the required features to that build).
  - Another [supported distribution](../../getting-started/kubernetes/requirements.mdx) with Linux kernel v5.3 or above.
  - Immutable operating systems (e.g., Talos Linux): Ensure the `CgroupV2Path` in the `FelixConfiguration` CRD is set to a writable path.

- An underlying network fabric that allows VXLAN traffic between hosts. In eBPF mode, VXLAN is used to forward Kubernetes NodePort traffic.

- IPv6

Limitations:
  
  - IPIP is not supported ($[prodname] iptables does not support it either). VXLAN is the recommended overlay for eBPF mode.

To enable IPv6 in eBPF mode, see [Configure dual stack or IPv6 only](../../networking/ipam/ipv6.mdx). You may be able to run with non-Calico IPAM. eks-cni is known to work.

### Not supported

- Other processor architectures.

- etcd datastore driver.  The etcd datastore driver doesn't support watching Kubernetes services, which is required for some features in eBPF mode.

- Distributions:

  - GKE. This is because of an incompatibility with the GKE CNI plugin.

  - RKE: eBPF mode cannot be enabled at install time because RKE doesn't provide
    a stable address for the API server. However, by following [these instructions](enabling-ebpf.mdx),
    it can be enabled as a post-install step.

- Clusters with some eBPF nodes and some standard data plane and/or Windows nodes.
- Floating IPs.
- SCTP (either for policy or services).
- Tagged VLAN devices.

### Performance

For best pod-to-pod performance, we recommend using an underlying network that doesn't require Calico to use an overlay. For example:

- A cluster within a single AWS subnet.
- A cluster using a compatible cloud provider's CNI (such as the AWS VPC CNI plugin).
- An on-prem cluster with BGP peering configured.

If you must use an overlay, we recommend that you use VXLAN, not IPIP. VXLAN has better performance than IPIP in
eBPF mode due to various kernel optimisations.

## Next steps

**Recommended**

- [Install in eBPF with auto configuration](install-ebpf.mdx)
- [Install in eBPF with manual configuration](install-ebpf-manual.mdx)
