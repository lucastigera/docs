## How to install

To install in eBPF mode, we recommend using the Tigera Operator to install $[prodname] so these instructions
use the operator. Installing $[prodname] normally consists of the following stages, which are covered by the
main installation guides:

- Create a cluster suitable to run $[prodname].
- Install the Tigera Operator (possibly via a Helm chart), and the associated Custom Resource Definitions.
- Apply a set of Custom Resources to tell the operator what to install.
- Wait for the operator to provision all the associated resources and report back via its status resource.


import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

### Auto configuration

You can choose the automatic eBPF configuration if your cluster meets the following requirements:
- Install $[prodname] with the Operator.
- Your cluster has <code>kube-proxy</code> running in the <code>kube-system</code> namespace.
- <code>kube-proxy</code> is <strong>not</strong> managed by an automated tool, such as Helm or ArgoCD.
- The Operator can access <code>kubernetes</code> service and endpoints.

### Manual configuration

If any of the auto-configuration requirements arenâ€™t met, manual configuration should be selected.
